“Home is my favorite feeling. It's fish sticks and Rice-a-Roni on the living room floor. It's mom's lawn-mowing tennis shoes. It's the silence that can rest between best friends. Home is screaming Ani DiFranco in the car all all the way to Chicago. It's the path lit by moonlight on Lake Michigan and the party in Puerto Rico. Home is squeezed into the corner booth at Maxine's on Christmas Eve. It's my husband's hand on my knee at dinner.”
