“I am fortunate in that my current living circumstance feels like home to me. But in truth "home' is not necessarily 'a place' with walls and a roof. For me it is more of an inner feeling. The feeling of happiness, of mental comfort, of safety, and of course love. I can be anywhere and feel at home.”
