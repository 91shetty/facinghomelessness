“Home is being with the people I love most, a thunderstorm, sitting in my best friends’ living room with a cup of tea. Home is dancing freely and being at peace with myself and others. Home is the smell of fresh cut grass, hiking in the mountains, and listening to waves crash on the shore. Home is the safety I feel in the embrace of someone who loves me. Home is love.”
