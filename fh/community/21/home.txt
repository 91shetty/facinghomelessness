“Home is where you can disagree and make mistakes and not lose love or peace over it. I've moved a lot, so home is not a place, it's a feeling, womb-like, warm and safe, a place where I can be vulnerable and strong at once. I still, against all odds, live in my ancestral home - not Jerusalem where I was born, but my true ancestral home, my body, which holds knowledge and wisdom from millennia. I work with my body and to the extent that I can be relaxed, strong, and playful in my body, I'm at home. I wish this for everyone, women especially, that we can feel at home in our bodies.”
