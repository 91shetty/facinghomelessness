“Home is where I am safe and loved and belong. You don’t need a house to have a home. You can be at home in a tent, or in the wide world. In the Buddhist tradition, when a person is ready to get serious about spiritual wisdom, they “go forth into homelessness.” They give up their attachment to a particular place and particular things so that they can cultivate liberation. But most of us aren’t ready for that yet.”
