“Home to me is more of a feeling than an actual structure. It's created inside of a structure but it feels like warmth, comfort, belonging, love, memories, security. In my home I'm able to be myself. It's nearly priceless and it's hard to imagine not having that. Whenever I've had a tough day I long to be home and I have a sense of relief when I get there.”
