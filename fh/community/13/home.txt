“Home is a space of centering. Whether it has a physical property or not, home allows us to ground ourselves in compassion, love, goodness, strength and wholeness. This space is defined by the people and tokens that shape your life through the ups and downs. Fostering a sense of belonging; I think we all wish to feel like we have a place in the world and this space can help us fill that need.”
