What is your connection to homelessness? <br>
My connection to this issue might be a lot like yours. I live in a little apartment with someone I love, and I believe everyone is deserving of at least that much. We are all worthy of coming home. I connect to this issue through a desire to live in a world where all of my neighbors feel like they belong and know they’re loved, seen, and safe. My connection to this issue is that, for a long time, I was overwhelmed by the complexity of homelessness, and used that as a way to justify not getting close to it. I’m no longer paralyzed by the fact that I don’t have the systemic solution, but I am still finding my place in the suffering, joy, and compassion of this beautiful community. If you’re on a similar journey, let’s chat :)
